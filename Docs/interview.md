We asked a nurse in a nursing home for elderly people some question regarding the entering of buildings and rooms with a digital “key”  


**Would you as a member of the staff and your clients benefit from a digital wireless key system?**  
It would benefit us both, most of the elderly are not able to quickly grab a key and put it in the keyhole anymore, the tags that could be used in a wireless system are easier to wear as let’s say a necklace and they are easier to hold in front of a scanner. For us it would be easier because we only need one key which can be changed “on the fly”


**Would it be beneficial for the clients to have their own key to be able to enter the common areas and their own room?**  
While our own clients have an “open” style of common areas (they can just walk in and out as they please) so it is never locked, but I could see that it would be easier for them to enter these areas if they would be closed. In our own nursing home we would use these new keys to let clients enter the building on their own, currently only staff can open those doors from the outside, of somebody needs to open it from the inside.


**Are there any areas closed for the clients?**  
At night most of the common areas are closed down, we also have an office for the nurses to which only the staff has access. We also have medicine lockers which are closed for the clients.


**Could you put the following aspects in order of importance.**  
 -   Security (Only access the required rooms)
 -   Speed (Don’t wait too long for a door to open)
 -   Ease of Use (Everybody should understand the system and be able to use it)


I can’t tell you whether security or ease of use is more important since both of them need to function 100% correctly. If nobody understands the system it is of no use and if there is a security flaw the system should clearly not be used. Security of our clients is one of our most important topics.
The speed is of course important, we should not be annoyed by the time we have the door opened but it currently takes a long time for us to find the keys and open the doors so that shouldn’t be too much of a problem.
