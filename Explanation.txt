I just added the rsa key to your rsa agent, and you got it added to your github account now.
So now you can clone repositories with: git clone [ssh thingie of repository]

Then the folder will be created, if you edit/create a file and want to upload it you first need to let gitbash know you edited it
to this by typing: [git add -A] in gitbash
then you need to add a commit message with: [git commit -m "your message here"]

now gitbash know which files you want to upload. then you can upload woth: [git push]

sometimes you cant push because someone else changed something, then you first need to pull with: [git pull]

So:
Edit file -> git add filename.extension
Add commit -> git commit -m "message"
Push to github -> git push
Pull from github -> git pull 
 
 push and pull are like send and get?
yes.

With git add -A you add all edited files in the folder to your commit. so the commit message will be applied to all files you changed and they all will be uploaded
hope this helps.
